## Deployment Pipeline (Updated)

1. Push code to **master branch** triggers GitHub Actions.  
2. Automated **tests run** using pytest.  
3. SSH into **AWS EC2 instance**.  
4. Docker stack rebuilds using `docker-compose` with updated services:
   - **MiniGDrive app**  
   - **Prometheus** for metrics collection  
   - **Grafana** for dashboard visualization  
5. Old containers are stopped and removed.  
6. **App data volumes are preserved**; **Grafana volume** can be optionally reset for fresh dashboards.  
7. New containers start with ports exposed:
   - App: **6000**
   - Prometheus: **9090**
   - Grafana: **3000**  
8. Nginx proxies requests from **port 80 ‚Üí app 6000**.  
9. **Access monitoring dashboards**:
   - Prometheus: `http://yourdomain.com:9090`
   - Grafana: `http://yourdomain.com:3000`

## Run with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t minigdrive .
   ```

2. **Run the stack with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access app and monitoring dashboards**:
   - App: `http://localhost:6000`
   - Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
   - Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

## Infrastructure Setup

- **Terraform** provisions AWS resources.  
- **Secrets** managed securely via **GitHub Actions**.  
- **Automated provisioning** ensures consistent dev/staging/production environments.  

---

## Security Notes

- **Password Security**: Passwords hashed via Werkzeug.  
- **Session Management**: Secure login sessions up to 7 days.  
- **Important**: Do not use personal credentials; use disposable accounts for testing.
